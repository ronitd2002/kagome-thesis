# Kagome Model

## Technical Questions : 
### Question 1: How many qubits in minimum would i need to approximately capture the essence of the whole infinite 2d kagome heisenberg model? i know this is a 

### Q2. What is the kagome heisenberg 2d infinite model ground state? Is the kagome lattice heisenberg model an infinite 2d model?
Ans: Yes, the Kagome Heisenberg model on a finite Kagome lattice can be extended to an infinite 2D model, often referred to as the Infinite Kagome Heisenberg Model.

In this infinite limit, the model has been studied extensively in the context of quantum antiferromagnetism and its properties. The infinite Kagome Heisenberg model is particularly interesting because it exhibits a range of unusual behavior, such as:

1. Non-trivial ground-state degeneracy: The model has a non-trivial ground state with multiple energy levels, rather than a single ground state.
2. Non-fermionic quasiparticles: The model can be mapped to a fermionic system, but the quasiparticles are not fermions in the classical sense.
3. Quantum Hall behavior: The model exhibits quantum Hall-like behavior, with quantized transverse magnetization and Hall conductivity.
