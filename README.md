# Heisenberg lattice energy estimation in kagome symmetry

---

## Theory behind the same:
The Kagome lattice is a hexagonal star shaped lattice structure and is an exaple of spin sheet. An inifitely expanding structure of a 2D local structure. We employ VQE to probe GS properties and find out more about the energy spectra using SSVQE etc. 

### Workload yet :
1. Try it out for simpler geometries like triangle and rectangle. Find energies, use a random su2 ansatz and run tests for the same against the connectivity graph hamiltonian. 
2. Check whether min eigval matches with the vqe generated minimum value. 
3. Now try error mitigation using ZNE etc.
4. Test trotter theory and check time evolution for theoretically derived minimum energy state.
